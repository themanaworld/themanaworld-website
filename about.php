<h3>Story</h3>
Start in the powerful city-state of Tulimshar before heading out into the vast expanses
of the desert. Get powerful and explore the small continent of Argaes where magic is
born. In The Mana World you are an adventurer and monster slayer defending the people
of the world from the threats created during the Great Quake. Even in the icy heights of
Nivalis there is a call for your assistance to keep the world safe and to grow your
potential.

<p>The Mage Council of Tulimshar has monitored events following the Great Quake and feel
that something ominous is spreading throughout The Mana World. Monsters seem to of
come out of every shadowy corner and petty dieties has begun to make presence in
dark places. The council has made the call and you are just one of the many people
that will battle the forces of evil, sending them back to the depths they came from.

<p>Be it warrior, archer or mage, you have answered the call from the leaders of the
world to fight back the darkness that spread after the Great Quake. Starting in
the Tonori desert, you battle your way to forests surrounding Hurnscald or the icy
mountains surrounding Nivalis. Monsters have nowhere to hide.
