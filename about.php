<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Mana World (TMW) is a serious effort to create an innovative free and
open source MMORPG. TMW uses 2D graphics and aims to create a large and diverse
interactive world. It is licensed under the GPL, making sure this game can't
ever run away from you.</p>

<p>The project includes the development of both a client and a server, as well
as the development of an online world. At the moment we're making alpha
releases of the client, while our server is in early development. The eAthena
free software Ragnarok Online server is used until our own server has matured
enough to replace it. Once ready, we'll be making releases of our server too so
anybody will be free to set up their own server and start building their own
online world.</p>
