<p>There are multiple servers where you can play The Mana World. Each server
can run a different world. Different servers may be set up for different target
languages, but also as an entirely separate projects. Below is a non-exhaustive
list of available servers.</p>

<p style="background-color: #ede2da; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid

two different servers. The server admins can read all of them in clear text and
nothing stops them from trying them on other servers. It happened a lot in the
past that users of the official server got "hacked" because they ignored this
important precaution.</p>

<h3>Global The Mana World server (English)</h3>

<p>Address: <b><tt>server.themanaworld.org</tt></b> (port 6901)<br/>
<a href="http://server.themanaworld.org/">Online player list</a>, <a href="http://server.themanaworld.org/stats/">Statistics</a></p>

<p>This is the official The Mana World server. The current client picks this as
the default server. One thing to keep in mind is that since it's open to
everybody, we ask you to speak English when around other people (other
languages are fine in party or private chat, of course).</p>

<h3>Alternative servers</h3>

<p>More servers can be found on the wiki <a href="http://wiki.themanaworld.org/index.php/Servers">Servers</a> page. You may also advertise your own server there!</p>
