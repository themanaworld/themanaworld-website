1167156154|Bjørn|The Mana World 0.0.22 released|Back in version 0.0.20 we had introduced females, but until now their clothes looked the same as they would on a male. Version 0.0.22 fixes this, with clothing following the natural shape of the female body. The character selection dialog has also been upgraded, and will show your character with its full equipment. In shops, the list of items has been enhanced with icons. Aside visual improvements, monsters will now make sounds as they attack or get hit. <br /><br />Numerous smaller issues were fixed. Among them are trading money, NPC dialogs staying open on respawn and joystick enabled option. Also, you can now hold your mouse button to keep walking, and you can walk through other players if there is no way around them.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> Our update host changed to "http://updates.themanaworld.org". If you're upgrading from a previous version and hadn't changed it yet, either update it in your config file or delete your config file. In the latter case it will be recreated with the new default setting.||http://themanaworld.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/images/avatars/66016003407c4993aaa39.gif|||

This release also adds new maps, monsters and a new hairstyle.<br /><br />On the technical side of things, this release brings a long awaited update to our animation system. It is now more flexible by having animations defined in XML. Also, some equipment is now visible on your player character, so you can finally start to show off your cool items to your friends! Finally, some corrections were made to the way the updating system worked. We may now actually be able to start using it reliably.<br /><br />It is important to note that due to these engine changes, it is required to update to 0.0.20.
